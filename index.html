<p>Recently I've been reading up on how to write a driver for my laptop's GPU. It's a Radeon HD 6310 (Evergreen/Palm) for which some public docs and an open source driver (Mesa) exist. It seems that sometimes the code in Mesa was written by people who had access to more information than just these docs. I made two tables showing which commands and registers show up in which projects/documents.</p>
